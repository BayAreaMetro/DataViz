## Publishing Curated Content to an External Audience with ArcGIS Online

**Any content that MTC indends to publish to external audiences via ArcGIS Online should be reviewed and shared publicly by the ArcGIS Online content administrator.**    

In the sections following, processes for publishing content to external audiences are documented. These processes are not final, and will likely be updated over time.

### Web Layers

1. Coordinate with data owner to ensure layer(s) should be shared with a public audience
2. If layer not already available in AGOL, follow guide on [Sharing with ArcGIS Pro](#share-with-arcgis-pro)
3. Update ownership of web layer from current owner to content_MTC (if not already owned by that user)
4. Ensure that web layer meets minimum documentation requirements for public content. See [detailed documentation requirements](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198481954367)
5. Ensure that content is tagged appropriately. See [tag strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
6. Share with public group(s) that best suites the content topic area(s). See [topic areas](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198481954367)

### Separate this conversation to be specifically about Open Data Layers
7. Share with Open Data Group (Any content shared with this group will be made available on MTC's Open Data Portal). See [MTC Open Data Layer Library](http://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=354e5d5c541c46a985891de9bfaa9703#overview) to see content already shared within the group.

### Web Maps

1. Ensure web layers used in web map have followed the process outlined in the [Web Layers Section](#web-layers)
2. Ensure web map is documented, following the basic documentation requirements. See [basic documentation requirements](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198481954367)
    - Detailed documentation not necessary for web maps as layers supporting the web map should be well - documented.
3. Ensure that content is tagged appropriately. See [tag strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
4. Share with [MTC Map Gallery Groups](http://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=4bb2944ff35348c3847859b48d28336d#overview)

### PDF Maps

1. Ensure web map is documented, following the basic documentation requirements. See [basic documentation requirements](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198481954367)
2. Ensure that content is tagged appropriately. See [tag strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
3. Share with [MTC Map Gallery Groups](http://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=4bb2944ff35348c3847859b48d28336d#overview)
