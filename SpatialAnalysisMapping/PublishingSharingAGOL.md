## Publishing Curated Content to an External Audience with ArcGIS Online

**Any content that MTC indends to publish to external audiences via ArcGIS Online should be reviewed and shared publicly by the ArcGIS Online content administrator.**    

In the sections following, processes for publishing content to external audiences are documented. These processes are not final, and will likely be updated over time.

### Web Layers

1. Coordinate with data owner to ensure layer(s) should be shared with a public audience
2. If layer not already available in AGOL, follow guide on [Sharing with ArcGIS Pro](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/DataVizSOP/blob/master/SpatialAnalysisMapping/AGOLTechnicalResources.md#publishing-web-layers-to-agol-with-arcgis-pro)
3. Update ownership of web layer from current owner to content_MTC (if not already owned by that user)
4. Ensure that web layer meets minimum documentation requirements for curated content. See [detailed documentation requirements](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/DataVizSOP/blob/master/SpatialAnalysisMapping/Documentation.md#detailed-documentation)
5. Ensure that content is tagged appropriately. See [tag strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
6. Share with public group(s) that best suites the content topic area(s). 

   | Content Topic Areas  |               |          |
   |----------------------|---------------|----------|
   | Transportation       | Demographic   | Policy   |
   | Transportation       | Environmental | Projects |

### Web Maps

1. Ensure web layers used in web map have followed the process outlined in the [Web Layers Section](#web-layers)
2. Ensure web map is documented, following the basic documentation requirements. See [basic documentation requirements](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/DataVizSOP/blob/master/SpatialAnalysisMapping/Documentation.md#basic-documentation)
    - Detailed documentation not necessary for web maps as layers supporting the web map should be well - documented.
3. Ensure that content is tagged appropriately. See [tag strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
4. Share with [MTC Map Gallery Groups](http://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=4bb2944ff35348c3847859b48d28336d#overview)

### PDF Maps

1. Ensure web map is documented, following the basic documentation requirements. See [basic documentation requirements](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/DataVizSOP/blob/master/SpatialAnalysisMapping/Documentation.md#basic-documentation)
2. Ensure that content is tagged appropriately. See [tag strategy](https://mtcdrive.app.box.com/file/198480762097)
3. Share with [MTC Map Gallery Groups](http://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=4bb2944ff35348c3847859b48d28336d#overview)

# Publishing Content to MTC's Open Data Portal 

1. Ensure content meets minimum requirements for [publishing curated content to an external audience](#publishing-curated-content-to-an-external-auidence-with-arcgis-online)
2. If publishing a web layer, ensure coordinate reference system is set to WGS84 (EPSG/SRID: 4326) 
3. Tag with appropriate open data category tag - **Note: if content not tagged, content will not be organized by category on open data site**

   | Open Data Categories |               |          |
   |----------------------|---------------|----------|
   | Transportation       | Demographic   | Policy   |
   | Transportation       | Environmental | Projects |

4. Share with Open Data Group (Any content shared with this group will be made available on MTC's Open Data Portal). See [MTC Open Data Layer Library](http://mtc.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=354e5d5c541c46a985891de9bfaa9703#overview) to see content already shared within the group.
