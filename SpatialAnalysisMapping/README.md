# Spatial Analysis & Mapping

This page is intended to be a resource to the Data Visualization team when beginning a spatial analysis or mapping project. This sub-repository contains standard operating proceedures (SOPs), best-practices, guidelines, and technical resources that should guide and inform our work. 

The table of contents below is an attempt to represent and classify spatial analysis and mapping projects into meaningful and useful categories. This page should be considered the 'jumping off' point to get started with an analysis or mapping project. Additionally, a summary of commonly used spatial and analysis acronyms and their meanings are available below.
