## The default metadata requirements for Open Data resources are:
  1. Metadata requirement one,
  2. Metadata requirement two, and
  3. Metadata requirement three

## The metadata related to the MTC public service(s) using one or more third-party resource(s) must:
  1. Prominantly state the third-party that created it,
  2. Identify the final/adopted document, plan, or policy the resource was used for,
  3. State that the data may not be the most current version available as it is not an MTC resource,
  4. State that the third-party is responsible for the content and quality of the resource,
  5. Include either a either a URL to the third-party's website where the public can obtain the resource for themselves or provide contact information for the third-party person/department the public can contact to obtain the resource, 
  6. Utilize the same metadata generated by the resource creator/originator (MTC specific information can be added if necessary), and
  7. Apply the license used by the third-party for their data. If the third-party does not have a set license, the MTC will use the most restrictive open data license as a default.
