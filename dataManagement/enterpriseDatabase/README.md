# Enterprise Database
The main role of the enterprise database is to serve as a repository for all authoritative/curated data produced or collected by the Data & Visualization Team for use by the section/agency. All data in the enterprise database will be included on the [MTC Data Portal](http://portal.mtcanalytics.org/) (Portal). If you are looking for information on Portal, you can find it [here](/enterprisePortal/).

The main difference between the enterprise database and Portal is access. Direct access to the enterprise database is restricted to the Data Administrator and the Data & Visualization Team. Other users in the section/agency will access data on the enterprise database through Portal.
