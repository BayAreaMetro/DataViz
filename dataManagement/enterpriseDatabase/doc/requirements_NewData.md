# Process for Getting New Data into Enterprise Database

1.	Determine if data should be distributed to full section/agency  
  - The one requirement is that the data is intended for regular use by more than two groups in section/agency.
  -	If data is only intended for one or two groups, it is not acceptable for the enterprise database. The group/individual who created the data will need to manage data location and user access

2.	Create metadata for data. No data will be posted to the enterprise database or made available to the Section without metadata.

3.	Inform enterprise database manager, using e-mail, the data is ready and where they can access it. If data is on ArcGIS Online, share the data with Curated DB review account (account name to be determined) and e-mail the enterprise database manager.

4.	 Enterprise database manager will review if data is ready to be loaded onto database  
  -	If more information is required, data will be held until information is provided and/or questions are answered
  -	If data meets all requirements it will be posted to posted to the enterprise database and metadata and services will be created on Portal
